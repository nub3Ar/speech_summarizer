A speech summarizer that takes in audio files and build out a summary using GPT-3.

I initially built this out to help my mom understand her accounting class better, then realized that I didn't have to reinvent the wheel for most of the components.

An alternative workflow that I'm doing right now is just to use transcripts generated by otter.ai and summarizing them using GPT-3 API calls
